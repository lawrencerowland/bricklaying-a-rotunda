          We built a visual “lens” model of an open dynamical system — an object moving in a
          circle, observed only through a small visible arc — to map how inputs (initial speed,
          position, radius) produce outputs (observed positions and timings).
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          This formalism uses category-theoretic lenses to link the system’s state space (manifold)
          to its input/output behaviour, with wiring diagrams showing composable pathways.

          The demo makes abstract maths tangible, giving PMs a clear, reusable blueprint for
          designing and simulating constrained process flows in any project environment.
